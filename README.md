# TechSmith-Takehome
Goal

The goal is to give us a chance to work together. We'll focus more on discussing code and collaborating than we will on your written code or style.

Task

Take 2-3 hours to write 3 or more functioning UI tests for the website at https://saucedemo.com. At a minimum, the tests should verify that a valid login is successful, that a valid login results in a store page with one or more of the items available for purchase, and your tests should fail if we use the problem_user or the locked_out_user. Your project should be stored in an online source control repository (suggestions below) so we can look at it together during your onsite interview.

Language/Platform

You may use any language or platform you wish. If you would prefer your own computer or if you choose a language/environment we don’t have on-site, then please bring the project on your own laptop. If you have any questions about our onsite laptop, feel free to reach out to us. We want to ensure we spend time looking at the code together instead of setting up the environment
We have computers here with the following setups:

● Microsoft Visual Studio Code on Windows

● Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows

● XCode on Mac

Rules:

● Do this project on your own and try to write it as you would a real work project

● Your tests should run and pass locally from your computer

● Your entire project should be stored on an account you control on Github, BitBucket, or
some other git-based source control

At the Interview

We’ll go over your project and code, then work together to fix it, improve it, and add new features as a team.
